# ROFL : Ripped. Off. Frontal. Lobe
## OOP-Game-Assignment-2017 ##
This is my game for the OOP 2017 assignment.

I based this game on Call of Duty Zombies and took a lot of inspiration from it. I have multiple things that can be seen on the real game like Perk 'O' Cola, powerups and the weapons. It is a top down infinite survival zombie game. It has infinite levels and a currency system which can be used to buy perks or guns. There is also a save game feature that saves the game to a file which can then be loaded up later. More on this will be described in the features section.

### How to Use ###
Movement is achieved using the W, A, S, D keys. You can purchase items using the Q key, and fire with the P key. You can cycle through weapons if you have more than one using the R key.

Upon loading the game there is the option to start a new game or load a previous game. When starting a new game you can firstly buy a gun of your choice. Zombies will be spawned randomly and will start following you inside. They will break the barriers around the windows, which you can build back up to make money.

The levels are infinite and they get progressively harder as they go on. You can save the game by purchasing a save game in the left of the room.

### The Perks ###

Double Tap Root Beer increases the rate of fire on the MP40 by 20%.

### The Guns ###

The M1911 is a low rate of fire hand gun that can hold 20 bullets at a time before more need to be bought. It packs a punch, but can be useless when there are a huge amount of the undead.

The MP40, rapid fire, good damage, and more ammo. All round a better gun than the M1911. Works well in a crowded area or when you have gathered a conga line of zombies and need to finish them. Be careful though, with Double Tap Rootbeer, this gun eats up ammo very quickly, make sure to be standing near the ammo crate to buy more!
